Face Mask Detection using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
in this we have some images of faces with mask and faces with out mask
we have to install first kaggle 
we unzip the the zip file 
download the needed libaries 
we will print the images with mask and with out mask
with mask will be 1 and with out mask will be 0
then we create the labels
we display the images with mask and with out mask
Image Processing

Resize the Images

Convert the images to numpy arrays
converting image list and label list to numpy arrays
we tarin test data will be split
Building a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
we will do model evalation
we will prtedict the image
